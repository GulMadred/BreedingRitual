#### Introduction

This is a mod for the game [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/]RimWorld[/url] by Tynan Sylvester.
The mod itself can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3401909982]here[/url]. It was developed by Steam user GulMadred.

This mod adds a new Precept to the game's Ideology system: a breeding ceremony. Two eligible pawns must be assigned to the same bed, which will cause a new button to appear on the bed's selection panel. Click the button to begin the ritual. The couple will perform Lovin' until they're exhausted, while spectators encourage them with dancing and music.

#### Version history

1.1
* Fixed a bug in application of config changes. If you found that some Options weren't getting applied properly before, please give them another try.
* Guests can now participate in Breeding rituals. This is slightly disruptive to the Hospitality mod, so it's disabled by default. Activate "Allow Guest Breeding" in the Mod Options if you'd like to try it.
* New option: "Show ideoligion VFX". This is enabled by default but it can optionally be disabled. I realized that the VFX fits poorly into small bedrooms. Players who perform rituals in such locations may not appreciate the visual clutter.
* Size of the Mod package has been reduced significantly. Source code moved to Github; preview image compressed.
